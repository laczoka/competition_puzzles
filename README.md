# About

Whenever I have some spare time, I enjoy cracking difficult algorithmic challenges or interesting puzzles.

I decided to start publishing them for the purpose of getting feedback and help others to learn a thing or two.

If you find an issue, or have a suggestion, please open a ticket on Github.
